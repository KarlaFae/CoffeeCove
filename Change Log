Update 12.10.25
Wrote the basic headings and description, attempted to add logo. Will fix later. Don't really know HTML at all but I hope this project will force me to be really good at it.

Update 12.12.25
Added more CSS and HTML formatting and built out the basic structure of the page, UI design/colors need more work but I will wait on having an actual team for those aspects. for now the aim is to make what is essentialy the equivalant of a "video forum" website
